# Caching
Caching is a fundamental topic in computer science. While caching is used in many unrelated areas in computer science, the idea of caching is saving pre-computed values. 

## Why do we need to cache values?
Let's say we have a function that computes some very complicated calculation that takes a lot of time:

```python
def super_complicated_calculation(n):
    ... thousands of lines of code ...
```

Let's say we need this calculation a lot (and therefore need to call this function a lot), especially with the same values. For some reason, we want to compute "super_complicated_calcuation(2)" a lot. 

```python
def func():
    super_complicated_calculation(2)
    ...
    ...
    ...
    super_complicated_calculation(2)
    ...
    ...
    ...
    super_complicated_calculation(2)
    ...
    ...
    ...
```

It would be a pretty slow program to call this value a lot. This brings up another question. Why do we need to recompute the same values over and over again? It turns out we really don't have to. Let's try to apply caching in this program:

```python
def func():
    two_calculated = super_complicated_calculation(2)
    ...
    ...
```

Now, we can just reference the variable two_calculated to get the value of "super_complicated_calcuation(2)" whenever we need it. Saves us a lot of time.

## Caching for multiple (and unknown number of) values
Let's look at the same example except we want to call a set of the same values over and over again:

```python
def func():
    super_complicated_calculation(2)
    ...
    ...
    ...
    super_complicated_calculation(1)
    ...
    ...
    ...
    super_complicated_calculation(2)
    ...
    ...
    ...
    super_complicated_calculation(1)
    super_complicated_calculation(1)
    super_complicated_calculation(2)
    ...
    ...
    ...
```

Here, we have two values that we want to cache, but there could be many more values. How do we approach this?
To simplify this issue, let's just assume that all of our values range from 0-9 but we need to compute all of these values a lot. Also assume that our calculated value can never be negative. What is a data structure that can store multiple values?

```python
def func():
    cached_values = [-1] * 10 # -1 represents that we haven't calculated yet

    if cached_values[2] == -1:
        cached_values[2] = super_complicated_calculation(2)
    two_calculated = cached_values[2]
    ...
    ...
    ...
```

We can use an array to store these values and reference them when we need them. We use strategies like this to almost hyper-optimize our programs. Sometimes it is unnecessary. Sometimes it is essential. Let's look at a specific case where it is needed.
