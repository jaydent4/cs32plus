# Memoization
This lesson goes into stuff that is not taught in CS 32 (in fact, this is a CS 180 concept). However, I personally think it is a pretty neat strategy that is very applicable with two topics the class has covered so far and a topic that was just covered: recursion, time complexity, and caching.

## What is bad about recursion?
If you did a thorough time complexity analysis of a recursive function, you may find that it has a bad time complexity.
