# CS 32+
Welcome to CS32+! This is a project for the Learning Assistant program's CS Focus group with the goal to improve CS education as a whole. This lesson guide is intended to work alongside CS 32's curriculum and as a more advanced lesson track compared to normal CS 32 lessons. It is only recommended to follow this lesson guide once you have a solid understanding of current CS 32's lessons.

This project addresses two concerns:
1. CS 32 does not cover more advanced data structures and algorithms that are useful in doing Leetcode-style questions. CS 32 also teaches in C++, which is not as common in coding interviews/coding assessments compared to Python.
2. CS 180 is too abstract and does not cover true code implementation of algorithms. It is difficult to apply these algorithms in a real code setting.

In this repo, we will go over Python and more advanced algorithms. In general, everything will be mostly taught in Python (for ease of the writer(me)) but some code examples may be shown in C++ as well. However, for reference, Python is probably your best bet in doing any technical interviews/OAs.
